# Shad4FastHtml

> Shad4FastHtml is a python package that integrates Shadcn/UI components with FastHtml. It provides the same styling as the Shadcn/UI library, but doesn't require using React/ Radix UI primitives.
 This is done by using vanilla javascript to add functionality to the components. This library aims to be functionally equivalent to Shadcn/UI, but some caveats apply.

Things to remember when using Shad4FastHtml components:

- Before using a Shad4FastHtml component, make sure the `ShadHead()` function is added to the app headers.
- Ensure that the `pico` parameter is set to `False` when creating the app (i.e. `app, rt = fast_app(pico=False, hdrs=(ShadHead(),))`).
- TailwindCSS styles must be included in the app headers. There are scripts available in the package to assist with local setup if needed. Otherwise, the tailwind cdn is available.
- Component implementation differs from one to another, so refer to the documentation for each component to see how it should be used.
- When using a component in the standard Shadcn/UI layout, make sure the top component has the attribute `standard` set to `True` so it renders correctly.
